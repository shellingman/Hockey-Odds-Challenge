# Hockey-Odds-Challenge

Given the data complete the following tasks:
1. Derive Over/Under 4.5 and 6.5 odds out of this data
2. Demonstrate the quality of your results
3. Comment on your solution(s)

The challenge will be evaluated on the accuracy of predictions, the efficency of the code, and interpretations of your results.

Information regarding some of the included variables:
* Set1_T1 represent the goals of Team 1 in the first third
* Set1_T2 represent the goals of Team 2 in the first third
* TotScore_T1 represent the goals of Team 1 in the regular time
* „Tipp1“, „TippX“, „Tipp2“ represent the matchodds of the regular time (so result after 60 min.)
* „Over4.5“ contains the odd, that there will be more than 4.5 goals (so at least 5) in that match
* „Under4.5“ contains the odd, that there will be less than 4.5 goals (so max. 4) in that match
* The “Over/Under (O/U) 5.5 goals” and Tipp 1X2 should be fair 100%-odds, reflecting the real probability (beside from obvious data-errors). These odds you can assume to be always available.
* The O/U 4.5 odds in the data might be wrong and are not complete
* An odd of 1.50 means that for 1€, you get 1.50€ back, meaning a net profit of 0.5€ (if you win)
